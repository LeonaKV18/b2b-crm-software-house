flow:

- clients comes in fills in a proposal description , function , non functional etc , value and the date he want it delivered by
- admin reviews , if wants to accept he assign a pm then clicks accept, optional comment
- admin can decline if so he gives a comment and  client can rework his proposal
- client can rework his proposal and admin can see it again
- now pm has it showing up in his project tab , he creates milestone and breaks the milestone into subtasks
- developer can see those project wise milestones and task he can mark tasks as done
- pm may mark a task as undone with comments
- pm now can mark a milestone as completed hence team moves to new milestone 
- pm marks project as completed
- client pays invoice




business roles:
- one user can only have one role admin , client ,pm and developer
- project manager cannot be assigned to more than 5 projects
- developers cannot work on more than 3 project 
- utilization calculated as assigned/total assignable for both pm and developers
- pm should see utilization score of developers as total and individual in reports
- clients are added through sign up
- client set to inactive after last  proposal/completed project is 6 month old through which a admin can message them
- admin can add pm and developers
- admin can only schedule meeting with pm and client
- pm can only schedule meeting client and developer i.e that are working on his project
- no teams developers are a pool and pm can assign them as he pleases provided they don't go above utilization score
- only difference between proposal/project is it has flag =0 latter has flag =1 approved proposal become projects
- once approved admin can only view progress of projects
- once approved pm can add  milestones / developers as he wants
- admin can set pm and developer as active or inactive , if pm and developer inactive they cannot be assigned or utilized
- admin has overall report
- pm just has report like utilization , on time stuff etc
- all users should have upcoming meetings widget
- pm and developers should have upcoming deadline widgets
- developers can lock in task in milestones
- developers can only marked locked in task as done
- no dead locks on task
- all meetings have minutes of meeting 
- minutes of meeting can be viewed later on
- pdf generation of reports and minutes of meeting

chore:
- make themes and colours consistent / professional across all users , maybe read from one theme file
- make db 3nf
- remove dead code
- all sql code should be in sql folder and divided into procedure.sql , trigger.sql and data.sql and table.sql
- code shouldn't break if I insert data from back end so apply necessary constraints and triggers
